# On Rust, GitHub Actions, and caching
# ===========
# Here's a list of things to keep in mind if you find yourself maintaing this
# CI:
#
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#matching-a-cache-key
#
# - `rustup show` is an unintuitive yet simple way to install and select your
#   desired Rust toolchain from `rust-toolchain.toml`.
#   See:
#     - https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/1397
#     - https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/2686
# - Always install and select the desired Rust toolchain before running
#   `Swatinem/rust-cache`. This is because the active Rust toolchain is used as
#   a cache key.
# - Be extremely aware of cache thrashing a.k.a. churning. GitHub Actions' cache
#   allows for 10GiB of data which is easily exceeded if not careful. The time
#   is takes to run your new, shiny CI might look very different 6 months from
#   now when your cache is overweight and has been invalidated over and over.
#   It's better not to cache than cache excessively (which kind of defeats the
#   purpose of a cache â€“ GitHub should really do better here).
# - `Swatinem/rust-cache` always invalidates the caches whenever rustc's version
#   changes, so it's less effective if you frequently update your nightly
#   version.
